I am a PhD student at the University of Coimbra, Portugal. My PhD project: "*Investigating the Atmospheric Impact of Disturbances in Land Cover: A Study of Precipitation and Temperature Changes in post-fire landscapes*." 

**Supervisors: Vasco Mantas (UC/CITEUC) / Courtney Schumacher (Texas A&M University)**

Since my undergraduate studies, I have shown great interest in two aspects: i) numbers, and ii) how space technology through Remote Sensing is able to record information from the earth's surface. Radar remote sensing fanatic! :grimacing:.
