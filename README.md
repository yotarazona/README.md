Master in Remote Sensing and GIS at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain. Geographer Engineer, National University of San Marcos Peru. Although my research area is focused to the field of forest disturbance mapping, I am open to work and research in different remote sensing domains including vegetation analysis, climate change, to name a few. All my academic achievements have been funded by various international agencies such as USAID-USA and PRONABEC-PERU.
