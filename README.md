I am PhD student at the University of Coimbra, Portugal. My PhD project: "Investigating the Atmospheric Impact of Disturbances in Land Cover: A Study of Precipitation and Temperature Changes in post-fire landscapes." 

I studied a master in Remote Sensing and GIS at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain. Geographer Engineer by the National University of San Marcos, Peru. Although my research area is focused to the field of forest disturbance mapping with optical an radar thecnology, I am open to work and research in different remote sensing domains including vegetation analysis, climate change, to name a few. Radar remote sensing fanatic! :grimacing:.

## Research areas

- Vegetation mapping and forest disturbance mapping with time series
- Atmospheric Impact of Disturbances in Land Cover
